# UCB FinTech Bootcamp Module 1 Challenge : Loan Analysis
## Introduction
The FinTech Bootcamp Module 1 Challenge - Loan Analysis consists of 5 sections, each with progressive difficulty, using the Python programming language to automate the analysis of a portfolio of loans and the GitHub repository to manage and deploy the developed solution
## Goals and Objectives
The goal is for the practicioners to create a python progran that solves the examples on each of the sections while getting familiar with the use of GitHub to manage and deploy code
## Tools
1. Python - Programming langiage for the solution
2. GitHub - Reposotory for code deployment and version management
3. MS Virtual Studio - IDE tool for coding and code testing
4. Git Bash console - Local console used to test the code
## Other Resources
1. GitLab - To access class examples and activities
2. UCB Bootcamp Dashboard - To attend class and review class materials
3. Slack - Tool to collaborate and communicate with FinTech Bootcamp participants
## Functional Specifications

## User Instructions
1. In Git Bash, navigate to the Github repository (1.Loan-Analysis) where the "Loan_A/nalyzer.py" Python program is located and execute using the python command
The Output for each section will be as follows
2. For submission purposes, below is the url for the Github repository where the source code of the python program  is located
https://github.com/LUTOV001/1.Loan-Analysis
loan_analyzer.py

### Part I - Automated Calculation
Provides the count of loans in the portfolio, the average value of the loans and the total amount for all loans
### Part II - Loan Data Analysis
1. Lists the different characteristics (variable values) for the loan: Price, remaining monthts, Repayment interval, future value.
2. Calculates the Present Value of the Loan using a 20% return rate and provides a buy/no-buy recommendation based on the comparison of the Present Value to the Loan acquisition price
### Part III - Financial Calculations
Provides the Present Value for a new Loan with the following variable values/parameters and considering a 20% return rate
loan_price: 800,
remaining_months: 12,
repayment_interval: "bullet",
future_value: 1000,
### Part IV - Conditional List of Loans
Out of a list of new loans, the program identifies those priced under $500 and saves them to a list of "Inexpensive Loans"
### Part V - 
Saves the Inexpensive Loans list to a csv file in the local working drive to be later 'pushed' to the GitHub repository
